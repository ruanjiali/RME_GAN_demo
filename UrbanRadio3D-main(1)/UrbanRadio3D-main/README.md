# Dataset Description
All datasets used in this project can be accessed via the following cloud storage links:

- Baidu Cloud Drive: [[link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nOyjVR3QHyGxzHzBWfbz6Q)]  
  Extraction Code is required.

- OneDrive: [[link](https://1drv.ms/f/c/43887b4a818e442b/EitEjoFKe4gggENwBwAAAAABbruOTF4HjJuAMgfCVmN-4A?e=M6CMQp)]  
  Extraction Code is required.

**The extraction code is located at the top of the redirect page after you complete the questionnaire. If you cannot find it, you may contact us via email at xcwang_1@stu.xidian.edu.cn.**

## Dataset Splits

We have provided recommended splits of the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate standardized model training and evaluation.

## File Description

- **Building_Infomation.zip**  
  This archive contains information on building heights and their spatial distribution, which serves as critical geometric features for wireless communication environment modeling.

- **Naming Convention for RM Maps**  
  Each RM (Radio Map) image file follows the naming format:  
  `xxx_Xxxx_Yxx.png`  
  Where:  
  - `xxx` indicates the building distribution map index  
  - `Xxxx` indicates the X-coordinate of the base station  
  - `Yxx` indicates the Y-coordinate of the base station  

This naming scheme allows precise identification of the RM map's corresponding building environment and base station location, facilitating further analysis and experimental reproducibility.
